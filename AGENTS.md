# FSRL Research Instructions

## Scientific north star

The project-level question is:

> How does a shared relational learning system transform sparse and partially
> encoded evidence into a stable, coherent, yet individualized global
> relational structure?

Behavioral reproduction is a competence gate, not the scientific endpoint.
Build toward an explanatory chain linking external evidence, subject-specific
effective evidence, meta-learned recurrent assembly, episode-local fast-weight
state, relational representation, and individualized behavior.

## Build claims from the full evidence

- Organize the working theory from all independently supported positive
  results. For each result, retain its protocol, estimand, controls, seed scope,
  provenance, and exact claim boundary.
- Do not erase a positive result merely because another link in the proposed
  mechanism failed. State which link remains supported and which link must be
  replaced.
- Do not respond to a valid negative result only by asking what smaller claim
  can still survive. Ask what assumption or missing mechanism prevents the
  supported positive phenomena from arising together, and design the next
  discriminating test around that diagnosis.
- Treat convergent negative fingerprints as an opportunity for a unified
  mechanism. Prefer one hypothesis that explains several discrepancies over
  unrelated patches that fit each metric separately.

## Use negative results to revise the route, not abandon the question

- First verify competence, implementation, measurement, and protocol fidelity.
  A failed competence gate is non-interpretable; a valid result below a frozen
  gate is mechanistic evidence.
- Keep the project-level scientific question separate from the claim supported
  by one checkpoint or experiment. A failed candidate should not defensively
  shrink the scientific question. However, the experiment-level conclusion
  must change when evidence falsifies a causal link; never retain an unsupported
  statement by relabeling or rhetorical qualification.
- Preserve negative results and use them to reject assumptions, redirect the
  mechanism, or identify a missing component. Do not explain them away, filter
  seeds, move thresholds, refit nuisance parameters, or select checkpoints to
  manufacture a pass.
- The next desired positive result must be mechanistically specified. It should
  show how the already-supported phenomena can be produced under the revised
  theory, not merely make a failed scalar metric numerically acceptable.

## Required research loop

For every substantive stage, record the following in order:

1. Scientific question and current theory.
2. Registered protocol, estimands, controls, competence gates, and stop rules.
3. Experiment or read-only analysis.
4. Positive results, negative results, and uncertainty.
5. Which causal links are supported, rejected, or still unidentified.
6. Revised theory explaining how the positive results could arise while
   respecting the negative constraints.
7. The next decisive test, including what each possible outcome would imply.

Keep exploratory and confirmatory work separate. Prefer analyses of existing
artifacts before retraining. Validate new mechanisms or workflow changes with
one to three seeds, then freeze the protocol before a formal multi-seed run.
Never tune on formal confirmation seeds. If diagnostics expose a missing
mechanism, preserve the frozen candidate as a baseline and register a new
candidate rather than editing the old confirmation contract after seeing its
results.

## Current FSRL direction

The held-out graph transfer, fast-weight necessity, stable subject-specific
evidence bottleneck, and antisymmetric subjective-rank geometry form the current
positive evidence backbone. The immediate unresolved question is how
`D_s -> P_T^(s) -> pi_s` performs global assembly.

Treat the excessive symbolic-distance slope, systematic deviation from the
uniform-prior exact posterior, and null context-average geometry as diagnostic
constraints on that assembly mechanism. Before scaling formal seeds or changing
the architecture, prioritize read-only analyses of the pilot checkpoints:

1. Human, exact-posterior, and neural slope-source and Hodge decomposition.
2. Support-trial trajectories from intermediate `P_t` states.
3. Leave-one-relation-out causal influence on unobserved pairs.
4. Identification of a reproducible meta-learned implicit prior.

The target is not a tuned slope. It is a testable account of how global
relational potential, local or conjunctive traces, evidence uncertainty, and a
learned prior jointly construct individualized rankings.

## Repository workflow

- Work on `dev`; reserve `main` for stable releases.
- Use GPU for neural training and evaluation when it materially helps. CPU is
  appropriate for lightweight tests, data checks, bootstrap summaries, and
  exact enumeration when it is the more efficient implementation.
- At the end of an experiment, preserve positive and negative outputs, run the
  scoped validation, commit the intended files, verify that the worktree is
  clean, and push to `origin/dev`.
- Do not include unrelated or incomplete changes merely to make the worktree
  clean.
